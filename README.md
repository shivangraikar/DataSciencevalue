## About

Welcome to the Data Science Unicorn -- Intelligent Salary Predictor! üöÄ

As machine learning continues to advance, believe in making it accessible to everyone through intuitive web applications. Our project is a bold attempt to create a user-friendly web application that predicts the probability of your annual salary based on your input.

### How It Works

1. **User Input**: Simply fill out the form with your details, including experience, education, skills, and more.

2. **Data Analysis**: The Intelligent Salary Predictor compares your responses with a vast dataset of survey responses.

3. **Prediction**: Using a sophisticated Logistic Regression model, we calculate the intercept score and predict your salary probability.

4. **Get Insights**: Get valuable insights into your standing within the industry and identify potential areas for growth.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Our web application provides a seamless and intuitive experience for users of all skill levels.

- **Data Security**: We prioritize data privacy and security to protect your personal information, all information is cleared and reset before every use.

## How to Use

1. The app was initially hosted on Heroku, unfortunately, Heroku charges for deploying web applications to use their dynos. You can still download and run it locally.

2. Fill out the form with your details and click "Predict."

3. Voila! Get your predicted annual salary probability and insights.
