## INTELLIGENT SALARY PREDICTOR

Machine Learning has advanced, web applications make it possible to deploy Machine Learning systems and access it through a web host. Our project focuses on this very ideology and is an attempt to create a web application that accepts user input from a Form and predicts the probability of Salary to be earned annually. The prediction is done by analyzing and comparing the user response with the dataset of the survey responses. This web application (INTELLIGENT SALARY PREDICTOR) is an integrated, efficient, and convenient application that provides another dimension, a new way, for Data scientists to know their standing in this particular field. It comprises a Logistic regression model to predict the intercept score and then use a formula to calculate the probability.
